# Practical Ksonnet Examples

This repository contains practical, real-world examples of using ksonnet to manage kubernetes
configurations in bite-size examples. Each directory is a separate ksonnet app which demonstrates
a single feature of Jsonnet/Ksonnet to achieve a specific use case. To run an example, clone
the repo and run `ks show default` inside the ksonnet app directory of an example. 

Contributions are welcome!
